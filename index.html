She was always patient in answering my questions, giving detailed and professional explanations after class by email as well. I received practical comments on each assignment that helped me improve my skills. In addition, in the client project, she invited a guest lecturer, Evan Abrams, to provide us with the instruction of motion graphics design and experience. In our hands-on projects, she introduced a variety of useful tools to enable us to work smoothly and efficiently with remote teams. I would recommend Prof. Joanna, she is super responsible, talented and loves teaching.</blockquote>
